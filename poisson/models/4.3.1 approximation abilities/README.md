These are the trained models for Section 4.3.1: Experiments on approximation abilities.

The results are shown in the following figure, which shows the PDE residual error and relative $L^2$ error with respect to the maximum neural operator modes $k_{max}$. The error curves show a descending tendency for the increase of $k_{max}$. The lower-right gray section covers the models that yields predictions with $E_{residual}$ smaller than the PDE residual error of the downsampled testing dataset.
